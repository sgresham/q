      prompt: `Write a captivating short story (approx. 250-500 words) about [insert theme or genre, e.g., 'a mysterious forest', 'space exploration', 'high school drama', etc.]. The story should have the following elements:

              1. **A protagonist**: Introduce a relatable main character with their own motivations, goals, and backstory.
              2. **Conflict**: Create an internal or external conflict that drives the plot forward and tests the protagonist's resolve.
              3. **Twist or surprise**: Include a surprising turn of events, revelation, or unexpected consequence that adds depth to the story.
              4. **Emotional resonance**: Make the reader feel something - joy, sadness, excitement, or empathy - by exploring themes like friendship, love, loss, or self-discovery.
              
              **Additional guidelines:**
              
              * Use descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and characters.
              * Vary sentence structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow.
              * Incorporate sensory details to bring the story to life.
              * Avoid clichÃ©s and overused tropes; instead, add unique twists or fresh perspectives.
              
              **Starting point:** Begin by introducing your protagonist in their everyday world. Then, as the story unfolds, take the reader on a journey through [insert theme or genre] that challenges the protagonist's assumptions and forces them to grow.`,

      prompt: `Write a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of integers, 'arr1' and 'arr2', as input. The function should return an array containing only the elements that are present in both 'arr1' and 'arr2'. If there are duplicate elements, include each one only once in the output array.

      Example inputs:

      arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6];

      
      Expected output: [3, 4]
      
      **Constraints:**
      * wrap all code within a code fence (triple backticks)
      * Use only built-in JavaScript functions and data structures (no external libraries or frameworks).
      * Your function should be able to handle arrays of any length.
      * If an element is present in both 'arr1' and 'arr2', include it only once in the output array.
      
      **Additional hint:** You can use the 'Set' data structure to help with the intersection operation. Think about how you could convert the input arrays to sets, find the intersection, and then convert back to an array.
      
      **Evaluation criteria:**
      
      * Correctness: Does your function produce the expected output for the given example inputs?
      * Efficiency: How well does your function perform in terms of time complexity and memory usage?

          * Add any relevant details or context (e.g., "I have a test tomorrow" or "I hate cooking, but my wife is making me do it").
          * End with a dash (-) followed by your preferred tone for my response:
            + -Sassy: Give me the snarky, sarcastic treatment.
            + -Helpful: Provide actual advice and guidance (but don't expect me to be too serious).
            + -Random: Just give me something weird and unexpected.
